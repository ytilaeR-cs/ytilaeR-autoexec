
Thank you for taking the time to download my autoexec cfg.

In order to edit the .cfg file you'll need notepad++ or a similar text editing program,
however I've included a plaintext notepad file containing an exact copy of the autoexec. 
You can edit the file in notepad, then when ready to save, 
choose all file types and save as a .cfg file.

To have the autoexec run when you start CSGO, simply place the autoexec.cfg (or your edited file) into
CSGO's CFG folder found on the drive you installed it on. 

This CFG folder is commonly found here;
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

However depending on your install locataion this may be different for you.
Another simple way to find game files is to right-click on CSGO in your steam library, click
properties, then click browse local files. This will take you to CSGO's main folder.

If for some reason the autoexec fails to execute on launch, and there is no "CFG" echoed in console,
add "+exec autoexec" to CSGO's launch options. I also recommend adding -high and -nojoy to your
launch options regardless of using an autoexec as they tend to give you a slight FPS boost.

Please note, the autoexec file MUST be named "autoexec.cfg" in order for CSGO to run the file on launch.

-high > sets the game to high priority letting your computer know you want to focus on running the game.
-nojoy > disables the controller support to save from having excess code running and thus save FPS.
+exec autoexec > tells CSGO to execute the autoexec.cfg upon launch.

If you have any questions or comments, or need help editing your CFG, feel free to contact me on discord.
